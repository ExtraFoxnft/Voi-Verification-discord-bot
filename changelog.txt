# Changelog

## [Alpha v0.2]

### Added
- Asynchronous calls to the NFT indexer API using `aiohttp` instead of synchronous `requests`.
- A dictionary `user_wallets` to map user IDs to their wallet addresses, ensuring one wallet per user.
- Role removal functionality to the `verify` command, which removes roles from users if they no longer hold the corresponding NFTs.
- Error handling for HTTP requests and Discord operations.

### Changed
- Replaced the `get_tokens_owned` function with an asynchronous version to improve performance.
- Updated the `verify` command to use the new asynchronous API calls and role management logic.
- The bot now stores a list of creator tokens upon startup, which is used for verifying user-owned tokens.

### Removed
- Direct calls to external metadata URIs for each token, which was outside the scope of the bot's verification process.

### Fixed
- The role assignment logic to correctly map creator wallets to their corresponding roles based on the user's current NFT holdings.
